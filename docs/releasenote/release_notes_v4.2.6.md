## 🚀 What's New in v4.2.6

### ✨ Highlights
- **Floating Window Layout & Dead Space Resolution**: Completely eliminated the persistent bottom dead space inside the floating keyboard window. By intercepting Android 15/16 window insets dispatch, dynamically disabling `fitsSystemWindows` on floating subviews, clamping occupied heights during measure passes, and performing a deferred re-measurement after layout transitions, the floating bubble now hugs key rows seamlessly with zero extraneous padding.
- **Flavor Consolidation (`standardfull` Merged into `standard`)**: Successfully finalized the flavor streamlining announced in v4.2.5. The legacy `standardfull` flavor has been merged directly into `standard`. LeanType is now officially published as two clean, focused flavors (`standard` and `offline`), both operating with zero `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission overhead. Existing `standardfull` users can install the `standard` APK directly as an in-place upgrade.
- **`TYPE_NULL` & Dialer Search Field Input**: Resolved an issue where input fields configured with `TYPE_NULL` (such as phone dialer search inputs and generic app search boxes) dropped input or caused keyboard dismissal. Explicit user show requests are now strictly respected.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Enhancements
- **Floating Popup Keys & Preview Clamping**: Corrected horizontal bounds calculation for key preview popups to prevent screen edge overflow in floating mode, and aligned popup rows strictly to parent key space coordinates.
- **Stray Navigation Bar Artifact Suppression**: Fixed an edge-case where a transparent navigation bar artifact could linger during floating mode transitions.
- **Pinned Selection State Fix**: Fixed an issue where the pinned text selection mode toggle in the suggestion strip did not reflect its active state properly.
- **Theme Contrast & Auto-Reload**: Improved high-contrast color evaluation for toolbar key icons and enhanced automatic reloading when the system switches between dark and light themes.

## 📦 Choose Your Flavor
